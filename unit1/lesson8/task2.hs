-- Q8.2 Calculating Fibonacci numbers is perhaps the single
-- most common example of a recursive function.
-- The most straightforward definition is as follows:
--  fib 0 = 0
--  fib 1 = 1
--  fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
-- Like the Ackermann function, this implementation quickly
-- explodes due to the mutually recursive calls. But unlike
-- the Ackermann function, there’s a much more efficient way to
-- compute the nth Fibonacci number. Write a function, fastFib,
-- that can compute the 1,000th Fibonacci number nearly instantly.
-- Hint: fastFib takes three arguments: n1, n2, and counter.
-- To calculate the 1,000th Fibonacci number, you call
-- fastFib 1 1 1000 and for the 5th, you call fastFib 1 1 5.

fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

fastFib _ _ 0 = 0
fastFib _ _ 1 = 1
fastFib _ _ 2 = 1
fastFib a b 3 = a + b
fastFib a b count = fastFib newA a newCount
    where newA = a + b
          newCount = count - 1
